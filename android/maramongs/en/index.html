						Footnote, The difference with the normal playlist<br>(1)If there is reproducing music, I play the music that was requested after it is finished. (I change it to a list of requests.)<br>

												<li>Random reproduction<br>
													<small>
						*I make a playlist not to do 100 pieces, overlap from a list of all songs.<br>
						(because there is a merit such as dispensing with time to let you choose the next music whenever one piece is over to go back up, and to listen to once again, I perform it with a playlist.)<br>
						*Making seems to stop on the way, but this is because it removes overlap.<br>
						*I collate it with a list of music that reproduced and omit the overlap with the music in there and list the music that is not regenerated as much as possible recently.<br>
						*The random play list is made by \ function \ random reproduction by the menu of the player screen and starts reproduction from the making direct next.<br>
						*I generate the list again when I revitalize the all songs on the list and repeat random reproduction.<br>
						*The number of the music to list sets it by a menu in number of the setting music " of the " random reproduction of \ or other \ setting \ playlists.<br>
						(It is around ten seconds with 100 pieces of the initial value;)
						</small></li>

												<li>Repeat reproduction<br>
													<small>
						*I perform the repetition reproduction that set a reproduction section in artist / album / one piece and music.<br>
						*The repeat play list is made by \ function \ random reproduction by the menu of the player screen and starts reproduction from the making direct next.<br>
						*The (A-B interval) reproduction between two points makes A list only for target music, too. When the start - endpoint chooses reproduction " between " two points, it is displayed.<br>
						*I display a bar to seek which did only the section which the bar to seek during the reproduction between two points made targeted for reproduction for blue gradation.<br>
						*The (A-B interval) reproduction between two points changes it to repeat reproduction of the music by the reproduction cancellation between \ function 2 yen points by the menu of the player screen.<br>
						*Start >> end time is displayed under the bar to seek during the (A-B room) reproduction between two points (indicating the reproduction position). I tap this frame or display the dialogue that I can coordinate by A menu in detail at the reproduction origin between \ function 2 yen points or the reproduction endpoint between two points.<br>

												<li>The appointed number of sheets extracts the album which I added recently.<br>
													<small>
						*I display a menu with a list screen and list it by an album unit from the thing which I added by \ function \ latest additional list update sequentially recently.<br>
						*An initial value is ten pieces and is the list of the artist / album / title of three classes.<br>
						*Because a list empties when I do it subject to a period when the period passes, I do whether you extract the number of the albums several pieces at least in a set point.</small>
												</li>
												<li>The number of the appointed music extracts a played musical piece recently.<br>
													<small>
						*I list latest several pieces in "the music that reproduced recently" from a playlist of the setting or appoint it.<br>
						*Even if I repeat the same music and reproduce, hold it for once and leave it for a list. (it supports needs to want to hear the same music endlessly by repeat reproduction on the next time.)<br>
						*An initial value is 100 pieces and is the single-layered list of titles.</small>

													<small>
						*Default of list of &quot; all songs &quot;
						</small><br> (3)Single-layered list of titles<br>
													<small>
						*Default of other playlists<br>
						*Because it is to weight not to be worthy of practical use when I make a long list with three classesI can appoint it whether you change it to two classes of lists of the artist bed list + album / title if the number of the registration music of the playlist is beyond several cases in separation " of the list of " setting / playlist / artists.
						</small>
													<li>note<br>
														<small>
						*Because the listing enables artist adjustment, only the list of all songs uses an original database file not a general-purpose playlist file.<br>
						*There is the thing that boot-time becomes late for a correction of the reproduction order when I discover addition and the destruction of the file with an existing playlist.<br>
						*I review the making program of the list of all songs and am improved speedup and the compilation judgment.<br>

						When there is not the music that I played last time in the list, a list is not found or displays the first piece on the all songs list and starts.<br>
						*An artist and the album of the list of all songs have a function to change the listing to the album of any artist (and making / holds an adjustment list).<br>
						The reset of the list of adjustment is a long tap of the list item and it was a displayed menu, but covers it in \ and others of \ menu \ or other \ setting when I display a list menu screen until now to avoid malfunction.</li>

					This is custom from the 1980s when the standard of the CD was fixed at, and a long silence area of one second enters the end of the music.<br>
					The long silence part is reproduced if I play a CD directly not to understand it, but a long silence part is included in the reproduction range when I do it in a file and does an island.<br>
